'''
Given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return a list answer of size 2 where:

answer[0] is a list of all distinct integers in nums1 which are not present in nums2.
answer[1] is a list of all distinct integers in nums2 which are not present in nums1.
Note that the integers in the lists may be returned in any order.

class Solution:
    def findDifference(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        return [list(set(nums1) - set(nums2)), list(set(nums2) - set(nums1))]

# Time complexity = O(n) where n is length of input array with bigger length
# Space complexity = O(n)
