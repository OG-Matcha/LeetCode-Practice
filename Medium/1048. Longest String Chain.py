'''
You are given an array of words where each word consists of lowercase English letters.

wordA is a predecessor of wordB if and only if we can insert exactly one letter anywhere 
in wordA without changing the order of the other characters to make it equal to wordB.

â€¢ For example, "abc" is a predecessor of "abac", while "cba" is not a predecessor of "bcad".

A word chain is a sequence of words [word1, word2, ..., wordk] with k >= 1, 
where word1 is a predecessor of word2, word2 is a predecessor of word3, and so on. 
A single word is trivially a word chain with k == 1.

Return the length of the longest possible word chain with words chosen from the given list of words.
